# Final Destiny

> We all dream of the next world awaiting us. It's time to board the spaceship and travel across the galaxy, where you will meet your final destiny...

Final Destiny was an original composition, created in collaboration with fellow blacker and friend [MusiMasta](https://www.youtube.com/@MusiMasta).

Overall, I feel like our work was a little rushed, with the different sections not really integrating all that nicely together. I think this could have been a far better composition if we spent a little more time trying to fit things together a little better, and spent more time balancing the melody against the (overly-loud) backing parts. 

I also desperately wish I could go back in time to tell myself not to add that key change -- the up-a-semitone-at-the-end trope is so overdone, and the leading chords I used to try and make it make sense don't fit at all. If for some reason you really want to critique an 8-year-old song with less than 10000 YouTube views, please assign the blame for that modulation abomination entirely to me.

Even still, it has some fun elements -- I especially like the B section melody and chords.
