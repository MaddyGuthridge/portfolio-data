# Ghostbusters

*Every time they say "ghost", it gets more impossible*

I made this arrangement very quickly, both for Halloween, and as a gift for my step brother Oscar, who at the time was obsessed with the song. I didn't take it too seriously, and I think I had more fun as a result.

Unfortunately, I made the mistake of using a compilation clip from the movie in the background, and so the video was immediately demonetized. Oops!

Note that it is near impossible to sync the MIDI with the music video for some reason, so don't attempt it unless you want to die of frustration.
