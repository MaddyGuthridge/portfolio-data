# Regina Spektor: The Call

This is my arrangement of The Call by Regina Spektor, from The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. I'm honestly not sure if I've seen the movie. At the very least I don't remember it. Either way, the song is lovely. I really like the modulated section in the bridge.

I created this black MIDI to explore the question of whether a Black MIDI could be beautiful. I do think that the arrangement is quite nice, but doesn't really fit the genre and style of Black MIDI. At the very least, some of the note art is a little too overstated for the relative quietness of the piece. This may also be partially due to the way that MIDI Trail (the software I used to display the piece) picks colours, based on MIDI channel rather than MIDI track, meaning that the pink colour was very overstated in my video.
