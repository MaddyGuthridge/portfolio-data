# HDSQ

HDSQ, short for hemidemisemiquaver (a 64th note), is a music project I started in 2016, where I create [Black MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_MIDI), a micro-genre of music utilising MIDI files that contain tens of thousands, or even millions of notes.

I'm incredibly proud of the music I created, and so I am using this section of my website as a way to archive and share my work with the world.

If you wish to make use of my work, please make sure to respect the conditions I have placed in the [HDSQ MIDI license](/hdsq/license), which applies to all of my work, except when specified otherwise.
