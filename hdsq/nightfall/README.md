# Nightfall

This is the conclusion of just under 2 years of work. You may recognise this composition from my 250 Subscribers video. Since then, I have remade this composition from scratch twice. The first version was for piano, clarinet and strings. This version has been written for a concert band. I composed this as my major work for HSC Music 1 in my final year of high school, receiving full marks.

## Special thanks

So many people helped make this composition possible.

* Patrick Guthridge, my incredibly talented brother, who mixed and mastered it. ([This is what it sounded like before he worked his magic](https://youtu.be/nC38g0SOnKU)).
* Yolanta Guthridge, my wonderful sister, who recorded the flute parts.
* Peter Stevenson who produced it, offering his time, expertise, and recording studio at a rate far cheaper than he should have.
* Roger Griffiths, my clarinet teacher and musical mentor, whose consistent encouragement and direction was a major driving force behind all of my work as a musician and composer.

## Compositional notes

In total this probably accumulated over 300 hours of work from me alone, making it an even bigger project than Tau.

Note that the sheet music lists the composer as "Miguel Guthridge". This is still me, but is my old name. Please refer to me as Maddy Guthridge.

If I find them, I will also upload the MuseScore project files and composition diary for this work.
