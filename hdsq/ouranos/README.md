# Ouranos

Ouranos is a Black MIDI which I composed in collaboration with [The Romanticist](https://www.youtube.com/@theromanticist8023) in 2019. The dissonant and demanding melody in the A-sections is inspired by the (as described by 2019 me) *"probably unsafe levels of stress"* I experienced in my final year of high school.
