# Sunrise

Sunrise was my second ever published Black MIDI, another original composition. I originally composed this piece on my Grandma Coco's piano. She was an incredibly talented pianist. She probably wouldn't have been able to play black MIDIs, but she was able to play [Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor](https://youtu.be/SCm9O2KNEX4), which is the next closest thing.
