# 花音: The Sound of a Flower

The Sound of a Flower was composed as a gift for my host sister Kanon, who lived with my family for two weeks as part of [my high school's exchange program](https://www.tareesc.catholic.edu.au/learning/curriculum/subjects-courses/languages/) with sister school [Kobe Kaisei Girls High School](https://www.kobekaisei.ed.jp/english/).

Note that the MuseScore file has been updated to reflect the way that I play it, as opposed to the way it is shown in the original video. It still has some formatting issues (due to the MuseScore 3 to 4 update), but if I get time, I will update it with fixes.

The MIDI file is the original version, which is presented in the video.
