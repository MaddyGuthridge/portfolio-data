# The Lion King: He Lives in You

I arranged this piece after hearing it many many times, primarily due to my sister's (at the time) obsession with the Broadway production. This is why I specifically arranged the Broadway version, as opposed to the (imo inferior) version from The Lion King 2. I am especially proud of my rendition of the percussion break.

When arranging this Black MIDI, I experimented with using non-piano instruments, at least in the audio (where I mixed it all using Audacity). Overall, I felt that this broke a little too far from the "traditional" Black MIDI style of creating all the sounds using piano sound-fonts exclusively, and so this isn't something I repeated in later works.
