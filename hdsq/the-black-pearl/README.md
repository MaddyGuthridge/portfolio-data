# Pirates of the Caribbean: The Black Pearl

This one was a little excessive... I think I focussed a little too hard on adding ten million notes, rather than making the arrangement musically good.

I'm also not especially proud of how I made use of other people's note art. Of course, their art is incredible, but it would have been cooler if I made all of the art myself.

The note art I used was from:

* The Destroyer by TSMB2
* Resonance by BusiedGem
* Death Swirl artwork by EpreTroll
* Shanghai Teahouse by ThinkerAI
