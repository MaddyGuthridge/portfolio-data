# Avicii: SOS

> *We could be more than just part time lovers*

Upon the release of Avicii's final album, **Tim**, I was inspired to arrange one of his final songs into a Black MIDI remix. His music was a huge inspiration for my own compositions, and I have always admired his ability to compose incredibly catchy melodies. I tried to capture this in the production of my arrangement, especially through the audio, which was mixed by my incredibly talented brother Patrick Guthridge.
