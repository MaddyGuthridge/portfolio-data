# Fractal Images

[Fractal Images](https://youtu.be/1ckTRZyJdWQ) is a beautiful Black MIDI composition by legendary blacker [TSMB2](https://www.youtube.com/@TheSuperMarioBros2). Largely inspired by my own desire to play the piece myself, I created an arrangement for piano solo.

Note that the sheet music lists the arranger as "Miguel Guthridge". My new name is Maddy Guthridge. Please use my new name to refer to me.
