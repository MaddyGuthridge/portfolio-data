# HDSQ MIDI License

Version 1.0, July 28th 2025.

## Preface

The Black MIDI Community is generally quite open with sharing their projects,
with project files and downloads often made available for others to use in
their own videos showcasing other people's projects. In keeping with this
tradition, I wish to make my work available to others in a way that gives them
freedom to use, enjoy and learn from my work. However, I also wish to preserve
my rights over my original work, and prevent my work from being misused or
stolen. As such, if you intend to use any of my work from this repository, you
must obey these terms.

## When uploading a "play-through" of my work

It is common for the Black MIDI Community to feature the work of other blackers
on their own channels. If you want to feature my work in a video you create
yourself (eg by playing the MIDI file using a tool such as
[Piano from Above](https://github.com/brian-pantano/PianoFromAbove)), that's
awesome! Please ensure that you do all of the following:

* Make the original author(s) of the work clear. It should be clear to anyone
  who watches the video who the original MIDI file was made by. You can do this
  by doing one of the following:
    * Including the name(s) of the author(s) in the video title.
    * Include the name(s) of the author(s) in a "banner" early in the video.
* Help viewers discover the original video(s) by linking back to it, either:
    * Within your video description, or
    * On your video's "End Screen",
    * Or preferably, both.
* Ensure that for works created as a collaboration, you feature all authors.
  For many of my projects, others have tended to drown out blackers I've
  collaborated with, with their videos just saying "By [author]". I want my
  collaborative works to be a celebration of the enormous amount of talent in
  our community, and so having artists I collaborate with be poorly-credited is
  a detriment to that goal.
* Ensure your video is your own work. To qualify for this category, the video
  must be primarily made by you, meaning you must generate the audio and video
  yourself. Don't just download one of my own videos and apply some filters.
* Do not publish your play-through onto music streaming platforms such as
  Spotify and Apple Music. This can cause copyright issues where I and other
  creators lose income for our original work.

If you desire, you may enable monetisation on your video provided you have met
the above conditions. There's no need to compensate me financially if you
showcase my Black MIDI projects in this way.

## When creating a remix of my work

It's incredibly flattering that you want to remix my work! However, I want to
ensure that my work is not outshone by an imitation when proper credit is not
given. Additionally, I don't think it is "cool" to repurpose parts of someone
else's work without permission. With this in mind, if you wish to create your
own version of one of my works, please obey the following conditions:

* If the work you are remixing is an arrangement of another song, please do not
  make a remix of my remix. Instead, you should create your own unique
  arrangement of the song, which is not derived from my work.
* If the work you are remixing is a collaboration with other creators, please
  also seek their permission, as well as obeying these terms. Please be
  respectful, and understand that they have no obligation to permit you to
  remix the work -- it is as much theirs as it is mine.
* Ensure that your remix is distinct from the original. It's no fun to make an
  imitation or reinvent the wheel. I want you to do something different.
  Perhaps you could change the style, or use it as a part of a mash-up. There's
  no specific criteria for this, aside from a general "vibe", but I reserve the
  right to take down any project which is not sufficiently distinct from the
  original. If you're unsure, please reach out and I'll happily share my
  thoughts on your plans.
* Do not use any components from my work in your remix. For example, copying
  "note art" or melodies directly is not cool. Your remix will be far more
  unique and fun if you create it from scratch.
* Ensure that you credit me (and any collaborators) as the original composers
  of the work, using the same criteria as when uploading a "play-through" of
  the work.
* You are free to share your remix in any way you desire, as long as:
    * The original composer remains clear in all locations it is distributed,
      and there is a link to view the original work in these locations too.
    * Your sharing of your remix does not negatively impact my original work,
      or "play-throughs" uploaded by others, for example through a copyright
      claim.
    * You require that anyone who uploads a play-through or remix of your remix
      also obeys these terms.

## When reacting to my work

Reaction content has a bad reputation. If you intend to react to my work,
please ensure you are adding your own meaningful commentary. In particular:

* You should provide some form of analysis or critique. If you're not pausing
  the video to discuss it in detail, you are not reacting, you're just watching
  and talking at the same time.
* Preferably, your analysis should be composed of thoughts and ideas you
  gathered before you hit record. That way it's far more likely that you are
  adding a meaningful contributions.
* Ensure that you credit me (and any collaborators) as the original composers
  of the work, using the same criteria as when uploading a "play-through" of
  the work.

## When using my work for any other purposes

* Please contact me to ask for permission first.
* Depending on the way in which you intend to use my work, I may request
  financial compensation for your usage.
* Do not use my work to train AI systems.
* Do not use my work as a part of a commercial or in a commercial work without
  my permission (aside from in the scenarios explicitly permitted above).

## Clarifications of terms

* I reserve the right to update these terms at any time, either to add new
  clarifications or restrictions.
* If you are unsure about any of the terms of this license, please contact me,
  and I will do my best to clarify.

## Copyright

* For copyright purposes, I retain the copyright for my work in all
  circumstances where I am legally the copyright holder.
* In particular, for my original compositions, I retain the rights to the
  composition, its arrangement, and the musical "performance" and video
  accompaniment.
* For my arrangements of other people's work, I retain the rights to my
  arrangement of the work, and the musical "performance" and video
  accompaniment.
* You shall not take any action which would infringe on my rights over my work,
  aside from actions explicitly permitted above.
