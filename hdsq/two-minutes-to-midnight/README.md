# Two Minutes to Midnight

In 2018, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Security Board set the doomsday clock to 2 minutes to midnight, the closest it had ever been at the time, cautioning that "divorcing public policy from empirical reality endangers us all" [[source](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/25/politics/doomsday-clock-closer-nuclear-midnight)].

Growing up in an uncertain world, and feeling powerless to change it was the source of this original composition's drastic tempo and evocative background imagery. In hindsight, I believe the work would be more impactful if it were less heavy-handed in its messaging, but this composition does capture my passionate-but-perhaps-overly-direct nature at the time of composition.

I am still very proud of this composition, and especially the key change near the end. Perhaps this black MIDI won't be the last you hear of these musical ideas.
