# If Death Waltz Was a Waltz

"Last Brutal Sister Flandre S", also referred to as "U.N. Owen was Her?" is a song from *Touhou 6: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*, which was arranged into a Black MIDI, and is recognised one of the first Black MIDI compositions. Due to reasons unbeknownst to me, the piece is often mislabelled as "Death Waltz", despite neither being a waltz, nor having any deaths associated with it.

To correct this, I created my magnum opus: ***If Death Waltz was a Waltz***, a rearrangement of the piece into 3/4 time, with such awful instrumentation that it is likely to cause at least one death at some point in the future.

In particular, the arrangement features:

* Piano
* Another Piano
* Violin
* Balalaika (whatever that is)
* Clavichord
* Bagpipes
* Electric guitar
* Out-of-tune oboe (like in real life)
* Kazoo
* Vocals, but like, the MIDI sound-font type
* Church organ
* Crash cymbal
* About 6 trombones
* And much more...

About half-way through the piece, there is a key change, but I intentionally made some of the "musicians" "forget" to change key.

It all culminates in what I believe is the worst chord I have ever written, all for your listening pleasure.

## Downloads

I don't have a MIDI file download. Instead, you get to enjoy the MuseScore file that I worked in, which (based on the horrific rendering of the glissandi) I believe has been exported to and imported from MIDI format several times, with varying levels of data corruption. I consider this to be the definitive way to enjoy this masterpiece. If you are using MuseScore 4, make sure to leave MuseSounds enabled because I think that using a good sound library makes this even funnier.
