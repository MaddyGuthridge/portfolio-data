# One Republic: Counting Stars

> Lately I've been losing sleep / Dreaming about the things that we could be

This is one of my proudest Black MIDI arrangements, with the audio being extremely balanced, without sounding out-of-place in the context of the note art. In particular, I tried a new technique where I used the channel pan filter to create a wider sound and place the various parts into a sound-scape, a technique which I explored further in later works such as my arrangement of [SOS by Avicii](./avicii-sos).
