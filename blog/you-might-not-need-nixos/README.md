# You Might Not Need NixOS

December 20th, 2025

NixOS is an extremely-hyped Linux distribution, which claims to offer many advantages over other systems. As with all extremely-hyped things, I'm pretty sure that it's overrated, and there are better alternatives,,,, right?

What did I discover? How does NixOS compare? Did it turn out that I was wrong and NixOS is actually an excellent Linux distribution? You'll have to watch the presentation to find out!

This is a re-recording of a talk I gave for the UNSW Linux society I gave on November 23rd. Unfortunately, the original recording had poor audio quality, and so I re-recorded it myself. Sorry about the audio desync issues.
