# Jasmin Assembly

Jasmin Assembly is an assembly language targeting the
[Java Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine). It
is a common output format used within compilers. The VC Compiler project that
I completed for
[UNSW's COMP3131 course](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2022/COMP3131/?year=2022)
compiles a simple C-like programming language to this format, so that it can be
transpiled into a `.jar` executable.
