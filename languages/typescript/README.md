# TypeScript

TypeScript is a type-safe superset of JavaScript, which compiles to plain JS.
It is often used in large projects due to the type-safety guarantees it can
offer.

I use TypeScript for almost all of my front-end programming, as the powerful
static analysis means that TypeScript's language server can provide intelligent
editor suggestions and advanced realtime error checking.
