# Python

Python is an interpreted, duck-typed programming language, which is known for
its flexibility and ease-of-use.

I have been programming in Python since 2020, and am very experienced with and
knowledgable about its ecosystem. I maintain several open-source Python
libraries, which are used within my own projects, as well as within tooling for
courses that I teach.
