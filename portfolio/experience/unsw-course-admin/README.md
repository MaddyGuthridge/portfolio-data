# Course Administrator at UNSW

***January 2023 - Present***

I have administrated UNSW's COMP1010 course since the start of 2023, where I have worked to rewrite its tutorial and lab content to increase student engagement.

Here are some of the comments I have received in UNSW's MyExperience feedback surveys that discuss my work as a course admin.

> So encouraging and always finds an answer to every question quickly and clearly.

> They are really helpful and show all their passion in teaching students and also in coding.
