# Band Director for UNSW Med Revue

***May - July 2022***

As the band director for UNSW Med Revue, a comedic theater production, I led a ten-member ensemble that performed over 30 minutes of music on each of the 4 show nights. My key responsibilities included:

* Arranging three polished musical numbers, showcasing my adaptability and creative collaboration skills.
* Leading rehearsals for both the band and various vocalists from other portfolios, highlighting my leadership, communication, and interpersonal skills.

Together, my ensemble delivered a performance of exceptional quality, earning acclaim from audiences and critics alike.
