# Tutor at UNSW

***September 2021 - Present***

I have tutored a wide variety of software engineering courses at UNSW.

| Course | Description | Experience |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| [COMP1531](https://handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/comp1531) | Software Engineering Fundamentals | 13 terms |
| [COMP1010](https://handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/comp1010) | The Art of Computing | 5 terms |
| [COMP2511](https://handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/comp2511) | Software Design and Architecture | 4 terms |
| [COMP2521](https://handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/comp2521) | Data Structures and Algorithms | 2 terms |

In all of the courses I teach, I have established a stellar reputation as someone who demonstrates great care and enthusiasm, both for the courses, and for my students. I am the kind of tutor who is willing to go above and beyond for my students. For example, I maintain a [personal project template](https://github.com/MaddyGuthridge/1531-template) for students to use after completing COMP1531. 

I pride myself on my ability to explain complex topics in an approachable manner, with engaging examples and a clear passion for the content I teach. I have consistently achieved a student satisfaction rate exceeding 90% for every term of every course I’ve taught.

Here are some of the comments I have received in UNSW's MyExperience feedback surveys.

> Very cheerful all the time which made the atmosphere 10x better. Their tutorials were the best part of my university week.

> A great tutor who gave great advice – [she] kept things interesting and their genuine passion and interest for the content inspired me and many others.

> Very enthusiastic tutor who could communicate ideas without just giving answers.

> Genuinely the most passionate and caring tutor I've ever had
. [Maddy] goes above and beyond in their teaching and is easy to follow.

> Whereas sometimes tutors aren't that useful or can't articulate the skills and knowledge they have,
Maddy was great at explaining issues or benefits of our implementations or examples.
