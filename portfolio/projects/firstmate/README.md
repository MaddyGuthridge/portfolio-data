# FirstMate

Find your crowd on campus at UNSW: FirstMate helps you make friends that work with your schedule.

I built this project over the course of 48 hours as part of a small team for [UNSW DevSoc's `HACKaByte`](https://hackabyte.devpost.com/) hackathon. We built our app as a unique and novel approach to address student loneliness and the struggle of making friends on campus. Our app received very positive feedback, and [won the ***Most Creative Project Award***](https://devpost.com/software/first-mate).

Made with \<3 by:

| Person | Role |
| ------ | ---- |
| [Benjamin Van](https://github.com/benjaminvan5) | Developer |
| [Esha Tripathi](https://github.com/theEastBlue) | Lead frontend developer, lead designer |
| Maddy Guthridge | Lead backend developer |
| [Sid Saini](https://github.com/Sid00721) | Backend developer |

FirstMate analyses a student's calendar to find overlaps with other students, allowing it to suggest times when both students will be on-campus. The user can then match with others, allowing them to contact each other and organise meetings at times algorithmically chosen to be convenient to both users.

I was the lead developer on our team, and implemented many features, including the overall project structure, user profiles and authentication, as well as contributing towards the calendar analysis, matchmaking algorithm and other features.
