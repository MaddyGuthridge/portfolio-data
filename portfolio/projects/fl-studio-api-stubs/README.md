# FL Studio API Stubs

FL Studio API Stubs thoroughly documents the MIDI Controller Scripting API in
the FL Studio audio workstation. The documentation can be accessed through an
easily-installed Python package to aid with development, or accessed online
through a detailed documentation site.

The documentation is of such high quality and offers such excellent
maintainability that in March of 2024, it was officially adopted by Image-Line.

Since then, my time [working with Image-Line](/portfolio/experience/image-line-developer-support) has come to an end, and so I no longer maintain this project myself. It remains open-source and publicly accessible.
