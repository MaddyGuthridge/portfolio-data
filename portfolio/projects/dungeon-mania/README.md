# Dungeon Mania

Dungeon Mania was a project I completed for
[UNSW's COMP2511 course](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2021/COMP2511).
It is a complex dungeon crawler game which I completed as the leader of a small
team of students. The game's rules were designed to challenge our design skills,
with extremely complex requirements for player and enemy movement.

In order to implement this project, we made heavy use of design patterns and
the object-oriented paradigm to encapsulate complex behaviours in simple
interfaces.

As this project was a university project, the source code is not public.
However, I am able to grant access to potential employers on request.
