# Transdoc


Transdoc is a framework for transforming documentation to ensure it is maximally user-friendly and accessible. It works by embedding the results of Python function calls within documentation, allowing for documentation authors to reduce repetition and increase ease of authoring without sacrificing on usability for users of the documentation.


It is used by Image-Line for their [FL Studio API Stubs](https://portfolio.maddyguthridge.com/projects/fl-studio-api-stubs) documentation to easily embed common warnings and notes within the documenation, as well as ensuring the documentation is maximally readable when consumed as Python docstrings, or as an HTML site. It is also used for the [UNSW COMP1010](https://portfolio.maddyguthridge.com/experience/unsw-course-admin) course to ensure that students' work is consistent and readable.
