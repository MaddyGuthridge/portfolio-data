# MarkTen

MarkTen is automation tool, which I created to mark students' work with ease.

I developed this as a part of my work for UNSW's COMP1010 course. It is used by tutors of that course, as well as in other courses to automate the tedious parts of marking students' work, such as `git clone`ing it, compiling it, or executing a web server.
