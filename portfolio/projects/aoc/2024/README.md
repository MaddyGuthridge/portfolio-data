# Advent of Code 2024

In 2024, I used a different language each day to solve Advent of Code. I started with what I believed would be the most challenging languages, with LibreOffice Calc and Scratch being nearly esoteric, before moving on to sensible choices. I attempted to use a diverse range of languages, and tried out many languages I had never written before.

| Day | Language         | Parts |
| --: | ---------------- | ----- |
| 01  | LibreOffice Calc | ✅✅  |
| 02  | Scratch          | ✅✅  |
| 03  | Typst            | ✅✅  |
| 04  | Julia            | ✅✅  |
| 05  | Prolog           | ✅✅  |
| 06  | Zig              | ✅✅  |
| 07  | HolyC            | ✅✅  |
| 08  | Nim              | ✅✅  |
| 09  | C                | ✅✅  |
| 10  | Haskell          | ✅✅  |
| 11  | Elixir           | ✅✅  |
| 12  | Dart             | ✅✅  |
| 13  | Nushell          | ✅✅  |
| 14  | Kotlin           | ✅✅  |

## Proudest solutions

* [Day 3](https://github.com/MaddyGuthridge/aoc-2024/blob/main/day03), where my solution produces a highlighted PDF, essentially showing its working.

* [Day 10](https://github.com/MaddyGuthridge/aoc-2024/blob/main/day10), where I learnt the notoriously challenging language Haskell (and liked it!)

* [Day 13](https://github.com/MaddyGuthridge/aoc-2024/blob/main/day13), where I wrote my solution using [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), a table-based shell programming language.
