# Advent of Code 2023

In 2023, I attempted the Advent of Code, and wrote complete solutions for the challenges I attempted using the Rust programming language.

## Proudest solutions

* [Day 21](https://github.com/MaddyGuthridge/aoc-2023/blob/main/src/day21.rs):
  my algorithm solves part 2 in less than 4 ms.

* [Day 11](https://github.com/MaddyGuthridge/aoc-2023/blob/main/src/day11.rs):
  my solution makes excellent use of functional programming to create a concise
  and readable algorithm.
