# Shuck Shell

Shuck is a simple Linux shell application which has similar behaviour to Bash.
I created it as an assignment for
[UNSW's COMP1521 course](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2021/COMP2521/)
in 2021.

It supports:

* Running arbitrary executables
* Simple output highlighting, such as exit code colours.
* Basic pipe operations (to/from file, and between applications)
