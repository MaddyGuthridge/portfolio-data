# Flapi

Flapi is a remote control system for the digital audio workstation FL Studio.
It works by interfacing with FL Studio's MIDI Controller Scripting API, sending
system-exclusive MIDI messages which are then processed by a Python server
running within FL Studio.

This framework allows for advanced control over FL Studio, which can be used to
build applications that offer advanced control over almost all aspects of FL
Studio.
