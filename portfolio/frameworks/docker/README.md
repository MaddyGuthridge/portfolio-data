# Docker


Docker is a containerization system for distributing and deploying software, where virtualization is used to contain complex software in a performant, but isolated environment.


I use Docker and Docker Compose for self-hosting the majority of my server-based projects, ensuring that my server remains both secure and easy to maintain.
