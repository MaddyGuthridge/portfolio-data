# Portfolio

My portfolio website was designed and developed by me. It is built with
Sveltekit, and features a data-driven design, making it easy to add and remove
content.

## Features

* Validation of all source data, using [Superstruct](https://docs.superstructjs.org/).
* Demos of terminal apps using [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).
* Intelligent cross-referencing between items using a labelling system based on
  the file hierarchy of the data directory.
* Advanced filtering of items, using cross-references to allow users to search
  for projects that meet their criteria.
