# Jestspectation

Jestspectation is a library containing advanced pattern matching tools to
simplify the process of testing complex data structures. It is used by
[UNSW's COMP1010 course "The Art of Computing"](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2023/COMP1010/?year=2023)
to help students validate their work easily and reliably, with simple error
messages to help explain where they went wrong when required.
