# Chess AI

This project is the start of a chess AI, inspired by
[Sebastian Lague's Coding Adventures video](https://youtu.be/U4ogK0MIzqk).
Currently, the project is extremely bare-bones and does not quite have correct
move generation.

I am not currently working on this project as I have many other projects that I
find more enjoyable and engaging to develop. However, if I return to this
project in the future, I hope to perfect the move generation, and implement a
simple AI -- my aim is to make it strong enough to beat me.
