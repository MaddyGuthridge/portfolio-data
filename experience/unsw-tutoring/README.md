# Tutor at UNSW

***September 2021 - Present***

I have tutored a wide variety of software engineering courses at UNSW.

* [COMP1531](https://handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/comp1531) Software Engineering Fundamentals
* [COMP2521](https://handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/comp2521) Data Structures and Algorithms
* [COMP2511](https://handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/current/comp2511) Object-Oriented Design & Programming

In all of the courses I teach, I have established a stellar reputation as someone who demonstrates great care and enthusiasm, both for the courses, and for my students. I pride myself on my ability to explain complex topics in an approachable manner, with engaging examples and a clear passion for the content I teach.

Here are some of the comments I have received in UNSW's MyExperience feedback surveys.

> Very cheerful all the time which made the atmosphere 10x better. Their tutorials were the best part of my university week.

> A great tutor who gave great advice – [they] kept things interesting and their genuine passion and interest for the content inspired me and many others.

> Very enthusiastic tutor who could communicate ideas without just giving answers.

I have consistently achieved a student satisfaction rate exceeding 90% for every term I’ve taught.
