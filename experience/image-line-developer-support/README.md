# Developer Support at Image-Line

***September 2022 - Present***

I supported software engineers at Image-Line by modernizing their Python API documentation and designing and testing enhancements to the API. Additionally, I provided technical support to developers utilizing the API, collaborating with Novation to test the software integration of their LaunchKey and FLKey series MIDI controllers.
